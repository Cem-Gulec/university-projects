### Generate test case from traininig data
If you don't have seperate test data, you can generate it from training data
`python3 testgen.py`

### Print accuracy
Set variable to `True` from `config.py`
Run `python3 app.py`

### Print predicted output classes
Set variable to `False` from `config.py`
Run `python3 app.py`
It creates `result.txt` file.
